\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Grand challenges of cyber-physical systems (CPS) include a high
computational cost of understanding the physical world.
Image-based object detection is one of compute-intensive tasks for CPS.
For example, an autonomous vehicle needs to detect and track other
vehicles by itself.
Current autonomous driving technologies \cite{Guizzo11, Levinson11,
Urmson08} tend to rely on active sensors such as GPS, RADAR, and LIDAR
\cite{Kirchner00, Streller02} together with very accurate pre-configured
maps, but the use of passive camera sensors is becoming more practical
due to recent advances in computer vision \cite{Dalal05, Felzenszwalb05,
Felzenszwalb10}: vision-based object detection can be applied for
various ranges and orientations.
In particular, histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) \cite{Dalal05}
features provide reliable high-level representations of an image
underlying many state-of-the-art object detection
algorithms~\cite{Felzenszwalb10, Geiger12, Rybski10, Suard06, Zhu06}.
However, a major concern of HOG-based object detection remains in
computational cost.

Previous work on the implementation of HOG-based object detection are
limited to either hardware implementations \cite{Kadota09, Karakaya09,
Komorkiewicz12} or specific parts of the HOG algorithm \cite{Chen11,
Prisacariu09}.
