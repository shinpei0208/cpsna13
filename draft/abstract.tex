Visione-based object detection using camera sensors is an essential piece
of perception for autonomous vehicles.
Various combinations of features and models can be applied to increase
the quality and speed of object detection.
A well-known approach uses histograms of oriented gradients (HOG)
with deformable models to detect a car in an image.
A major challenge of this approach can be found in computational cost
introducing a real-time constraint problem in the real world.
In this paper, we present an implementation technique using graphics
processing units (GPUs) to accelerate computations of scoring similarity
of the input image and the pre-defined models.
Our implementation considers not only the algorithm part but also the
entire program structure for practical use.
We also apply the presented technique for the real-world car detection
program and demonstrate that our implementation using commodity
GPUs can achieve speedups of 1.5x to 3x in frame-rate over sequential
and multithreaded implementations using traditional CPUs.
