\section{GPU Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

This paper presents GPU implementations of the existing object
detection program using a pupular computer vision technique
\cite{Niknejad12}.
Our contribution is distinguished from prior GPU implementations work
\cite{Chen11, Prisacariu09} in that we analyze the performance
characteristics of the object detection program to figure out what part
of the program should be accelerated using the GPU and our
implementations build on this analysis optimizing performance.

Note that this paper focuses on vehicle detection but the presented GPU
implementations and our technical contribution can be applied for other
object detection methods using HOG features and deformable models.
